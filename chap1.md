# intro to spring framework:

The Spring Framework is a powerful, lightweight, and widely used Java framework for building enterprise applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for Java-based applications, making development faster, scalable, and maintainable.

1. a replacement to `enterprise java beans`. cuz it was complex.
2. Emerged as a solution to EJB by
   1. aspect oriented programming
   2. POJO
   3. DI

## what is spring framework:

- simplifies java development
- promotes good design practises.
- comprehensive infrastructure.
- provides in built tools.

### benefits:

- simplified development , reduces boiler plate code with DI fature and AOP .
- loose coupling : DI ensures that the components are loosely coupled.
- modularity .
- integration support.
- scalable.

### features :

The key features of Spring Framework are listed below:

- Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection is a design pattern where the Spring container automatically provides the required dependencies to a class, instead of the class creating them itself. This promotes `loose coupling`,` easier testing`, and `better maintainability` by decoupling the object creation and usage.
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): AOP allows developers to separate cross-cutting concerns (such as `logging`, `security`, and `transaction` management) from the business logic.
- Transaction Management: Spring provides a consistent abstraction for managing transactions across various databases and message services.
- Spring MVC: It is a powerful framework for building web applications that follow the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- Spring Security: Spring provides security features like authentication, authorization, and more.
- Spring Data: Spring Data is a part of the Spring Framework that simplifies database access by `providing easy-to-use abstractions for working with relational and non-relational databases.`
- Spring Batch: Spring Batch is a framework in Spring for handling large-scale batch processing, such as reading, processing, and writing data in bulk.
- Integration with Other Frameworks: Spring integrates seamlessly with other technologies like Hibernate, JPA, JMS, and more, making it versatile for various enterprise applications.
