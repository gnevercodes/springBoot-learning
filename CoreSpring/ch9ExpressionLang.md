# Expression Language (SpEL) - `‚ÄúA way to talk to Java objects using expressions at runtime. Like math, logic, and method calls‚Ä¶ all in strings.‚Äù`

SpEL (Spring Expression Language) is like a mini language inside Spring that lets you write expressions to:

1. access bean props.
2. call methods.
3. perform arithmetic ops .
4. conditional logic.

```java
@Value("#{systemProperties['user.name']}")
@Value("#{environment['JAVA_HOME']}")
@Value("#{5 * 10}")
private int calculatedValue;

```

üîê Gotchas:
‚Ä¢ Use #{} not ${} ‚Äî ${} is for property placeholder (like application.properties), whereas #{} is for SpEL.
‚Ä¢ SpEL runs at runtime ‚Äî so if you mess up the expression, it will fail at runtime, not compile time.

main :

1.  Expression : this is a compiled expresion like end result of some additin : like the end result of parsing your expression string
2.  ExpressionParser (Interface)
    ‚Ä¢ This is the engine that takes your SpEL expression string and turns it into an Expression object.
    ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs an interface, meaning you don‚Äôt directly use it‚Äîyou use its implementation.
