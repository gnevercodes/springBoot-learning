# Basics important i will be using in my full stack development

Thing What It Is Why It Matters  
Dependency External library your project needs , So you don’t reinvent the wheel
YAML (.yml) , Config/settings file , Clean way to tell Spring how to behave
JSON (.json) , Data format used in APIs , Backend ↔ Frontend communication

- MAVEN AND GRADLE.
  Both Maven and Gradle help manage:
  1.  📦 Dependencies – Libraries your project needs (like Spring Boot, MySQL connector, etc.)
  2.  🛠️ Build process – Compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying your code.
  3.  🔁 Project structure and lifecycle – Defining how your app should behave in different phases (e.g., compile, test, package, deploy).
  4.  ✅ Reproducibility – So your app builds the same way every time, for every developer or server.

- Notes by naveen : MAVEN
  1. we need lots of dependencies when creating project (jar files)
  2. we need to download manually and use them .
  3. but problem is , we need to update them manually , and match them .
  4. So , maven helps get those jar files.
  5. it has pom xml file ,
  6. `groupID` : should be unique for myself .
  7. `artifactid`.
